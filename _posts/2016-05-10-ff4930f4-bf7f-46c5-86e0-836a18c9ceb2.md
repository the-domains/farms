We have been asked if we are able to offer home stays. The answer in the short term is 'maybe soon' - but in the longer term it's 'certainly'. 

We are drawing up plans for home stays in the original farmhouse, as well as constructing guest houses in secluded areas around the farm. The long term plans will provide a luxurious guest wing adjacent to our planned new house complete with a shaded lap pool and a cooling plunge pool. 

Guest bungalows will be of solid traditional European-style construction fitted out with king or queen size beds, full air conditioning and private bath / shower / toilet. Step out onto a private terrace with fish-filled lily ponds featuring cooling waterfalls or fountains, plunge pool and Jacuzzi.
