Our farms cascade down a gentle hillside towards rice fields. The lower farm mainly grows crops for our organic livestock feeding program; on both upper and lower farms we also grow crops for consumption by us and our small workforce; also to supply tasty and healthy meals to people staying in our guest accommodation; as well as assisting some needy local families.

Lettuce, rocket, tomatoes, spring onions, shallots and peppers; herbs to make our fresh food taste even better. Staples like potatoes, carrots, onions, sweet potato, beans as well as many indigenous root and leaf vegetables.

Beyond our lower farm is spread over 150 hectares of the local community's irrigated rice fields owned by many area residents and farmers. Family members own or farm about 5 hectares of rice adjacent to or nearby our farms. Although it leads to lower yields, we continue our preference for local seeds which provide a tasty flavorful rice; and shun any attempt to use GMO seeds which are not sustainable - as although those produce a greater yield, that requires new seed be purchased every growing season.
