We have been asked if we are able to offer home stays. The answer in the short term is 'maybe soon' - but in the longer term it's 'certainly'.

Those seeking luxurious European-style guest accommodation will enjoy a choice of being in a secluded private garden with fish-filled lily ponds. A deluxe hotel wing will feature private balconies with panoramic views of nearby mountains.We also plan to add both a shaded plunge pool, a lap pool and jacuzzi.

We will also be constructing Filipino bahay-type guest houses in secluded areas around the farm; surrounded by plants and flowers with cooling fountains and ponds.

The luxury guest accommodations will be of solid traditional European-style construction. All rooms will provide king or queen beds, full split air conditioning with private shower and toilet, and either a private balcony or direct access to a private garden or terrace.
