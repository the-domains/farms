Beyond our lower farm is spread over 150 hectares of the local community's irrigated rice fields owned by many area residents and farmers, including ourselves...

Our family members own or farm about 5 hectares of rice adjacent to or nearby our farms. Although it leads to lower yields, we continue our preference for local seeds which provide a tasty flavorful rice; and shun any attempt to use GMO seeds - which are unsustainable - although those produce a greater yield, GMO requires new seed must be purchased every growing season.
