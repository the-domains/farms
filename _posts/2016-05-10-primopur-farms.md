![Here's grandpa doing what he loves best, tending our family farms... ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/655fbe87-7727-4893-ba03-f33138ac40ba.jpg)

We are located in central Philippines, on Luzon, the largest island - in the Bicol region, several hundred kilometres south of the capital, Manila.

Just minutes from the Pacific Ocean, cooled by sea breezes, our farms cover around 10 hectares of arable land and woodlands that family members have taken care of for much of the past 20 years. In that time we have not knowingly used chemical fertilizers or herbicides.

We recently started a transition from traditional subsistence farming to organic farm production, adhering to established principles of both sustainable and organic farming. We want to have a positive impact on the environment and other local families
