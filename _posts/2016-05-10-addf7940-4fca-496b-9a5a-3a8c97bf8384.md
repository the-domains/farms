Our farms cascade down a gentle hillside towards rice fields. The lower farm mainly grows crops for our organic livestock feeding program; on both upper and lower farms we also grow crops for consumption by us and our small workforce; also to supply tasty and healthy meals to people staying in our guest accommodation; as well as assisting some needy local families.

Lettuce, rocket, tomatoes, spring onions, shallots and peppers; herbs to make our fresh food taste even better. Staples like potatoes, carrots, onions, sweet potato, beans as well as many indigenous root and leaf vegetables.e; and shun any attempt to use GMO seeds which are not sustainable - as although those produce a greater yield, that requires new seed be purchased every growing season.
