We are encouraging animals to exercise and root around in the cool fresh morning air.

We are totally committed to sustainable organic farming so have restored an old piggery using local native materials. Within the piggery area, most of the pens have earthen bases overlaid with a mix of sawdust and rice husks, giving all the pigs and piglets easily cleaned, sweet smelling, compostable bedding.
