On almost 10 hectares of family-owned farmlands facing the Pacific Ocean in the southern Luzon region of Bicol, we are in the process of creating an organic farming community. Over the past 15 years we have not introduced artificial feeds or chemicals to this land. We are gradually moving from subsistence farming of coconut, pili nuts, rice, pigs and chickens to a full production farm using organic principles. 

We are still early in the process - retaining our mature hardwoods which provide excellent cover while planting more; retaining some coconut trees to contribute to livestock & poultry feeds. We are clearing areas to gradually introduce more successful organic crops like cacao, fruits, vegetables and salad plants. We are ramping up our organic animal feed production which we plan to not only to feed our animals, but to also market commercially to local farmers as a cost effective and healthy alternative to expensive commercial feeds. 

To support the introduction of wholly organic livestock we are continuously building spacious pens with extensive runs for chickens, ducks, geese, pigs and goats to give them controlled freedom to roam.
