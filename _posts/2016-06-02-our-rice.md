Beyond our lower farm is spread over 150 hectares of the local community's irrigated rice fields owned by many area residents and farmers. 

Our family members own or farm about 5 hectares of rice adjacent to or nearby our farms. Although it leads to lower yields, we continue our preference for local seeds which provide a tasty flavorful rice; and shun any attempt to use GMO seeds which are not sustainable - as although those produce a greater yield, that requires new seed be purchased every growing season.
