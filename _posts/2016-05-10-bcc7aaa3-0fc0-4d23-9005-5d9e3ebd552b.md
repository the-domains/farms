We are retaining all our good hardwoods, including numerous Pili trees (producing pili nut candy, a well beloved regional specialty). 

We are replacing older coconut trees with a less-resource demanding variety that tops out at about 3 meters in height. This serves multiple uses, including the opportunity to extract our own healthy organic virgin coconut oil - mainly to use in our own kitchens for cooking and baking. 

From our home nursery we are bringing on Nara (a native Filipino hardwood) seedlings from our family's hill farm. These will be transplanted to create a woodland area for the benefit of future generations - as they take up to 40 years to reach maturity.

We plan to intersperse trees with cacao - as these beans are relatively easy to grow under cover of the bigger trees and are a valuable crop for chocolate production.

Our fruit bearing trees include a flavorful variety of mango, some mangosteen and durian, plus avocados, bananas, calamansi (a small but strong flavored Asian lemon), as well as papaya.

We are working in the longer term on creating a Mediterranean type citrus grove replete with oranges, lemons and grapefruit - but that's still sine years before reaching maturity!
