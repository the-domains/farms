We currently use 3 deep wells around the property to supply about 3000 liters of potable water every day.

We are introducing solar water heating and eventually electricity will, whenever possible, come from solar or wind. All air conditioning, refrigeration and laundry equipment uses the latest high-efficiency inverter technology to minimise power demands.

Any wastes are disposed of using the best recycling options we have available to us. All animal waste, plus occasional small amounts of food/crop waste, is cycled into manure for the crops.

Our goats are eating their way through any undergrowth, although they also love ornamental pepper bushes! The geese voraciously attack the lawns, keeping them under control and provide us with free guard duty around the clock.

Our ducks are out patrolling the rice fields during the growing season; between their love of eating weeds and their waste enriching the soil we no longer need to weed the rice fields and our crop yields are improving.
